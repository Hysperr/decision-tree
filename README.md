# Decision_Tree
###### C++11 Required ######

These files demonstrate xml parsing, std::chrono capabilities, depth first and breadth first searching.
This program builds a decision tree by reading and parsing `tree.xml`. A list of possible actions is generated for the user to search for. If a searched action exists within the tree, the tree generates a stochastic response for **any** leaf node that is a descendant of the searched node. If the user searches for a leaf and it is found within the tree, that searched leaf will be retrieved.
