# Decision_Game_Tree
###### C++11 Required ######

Decision_Game_Tree demonstrates xml parsing, std::chrono capabilities, depth first and breadth first searching.
This program builds a decision tree by reading and parsing `tree.xml`. A list of possible actions is generated for the user to search for. If an action is located in the tree, the tree generates a stochastic response for **any** leaf node that is a descendant of the searched node. If a leaf is searched and is found, the leaf will be retrived.
